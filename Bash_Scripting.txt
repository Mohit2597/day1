	21.Debugging bash Scripts

	cat /etc/shells
	which bash
1. FILENAME = NAME.sh
		chmod +x Name.sh
		EXECUTEFILE=./sh
2. REDIRECT TO FILE
		cat /etc/shells >redirect.txt
		cat >>redirect.txt 
3. COMMENTS
		# ONE LINE COMMENT
		: ' EVERYTHING BETWEEN WILL BE COMMENTED OUT '
		cat <<Screenshot
		This will be printed on Termincal Screen 
		Screenshot
4. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
	&& is for both the true statement
	|| is for either one of the statement is ture

			if (( Condition ))
			then
				echo "Hello,World"
			elif
			then
				echo "Hello World Elseif"
			else
				echo "Hello Else"
			fi
	Note: statement starts with if and ends with fi, after if we use then , for elseif we use elif and then there must be space (( One Space from both Ends ))
5. LOOPS

	while/for/untill

	while [[ conditon ]]
	do 
		WHATEVER YOU WANTS TODO
	done
6. SCRIPT INPUT
	args=("$@")
	echo #@
	echo $@
								args : this is how you define an array
								"$@" : to get unlimited no of arguments in array
								$# : length of array
								$@ : print array arguments
    Create read file programme
7. SCRIPT 	OUTPUT
	ls -al 1>success.txt 2>error.txt
	ls -al >& error&success both files are same

8. PIPES (send output from one script to another)
	export :)
9. STRINGS PROCESSING








$ echo "The cost of the item is $15"
 The cost of the item is 5


$echo "The cost of the itme is \$15"
The cost of the itme is $15

days=10
guest="katie"
echo "$guest check in $days days ago"
days=5
guest="Mohit"
echo"$guest check in $days days ago"

#assigning variable value to to the another variable
value1=10
value2=$value1
echo "the resulting value is $value2"



#Command substitution
testing=$(date)
echo "the date and time are :" $testing


#redirecting Input and Output

command > outputfile(overwrite)
command >> outputfile(append)

			###Input Redirection ###
wc < outputfile
rpm -qa > rpm_list
sort < rpm_list

			####Pipes####
command1 | command 2
rpm -qa | sort
ls /dev | sort | head -n 5

		###PERFORMING MATH ####
expr 1 + 6
expr 5 \* 2

var1=10
var2=20
var3=$(expr $var2 / $var1)
echo $var3

		####Using brackets
var1=100
var2=200
var3=300
var4=$[$var1 * ($var2 - $var1)]
echo $var4



#### using bc ####
scale =4

	var1=$(echo "scale:4 3.44 / 5" | bc)
	echo $var1

### exiting the script 

0			successfull completion of command
1			General unknown error
2			Misuse of Shell commnad
126		The commnad can't execute
127		command not found
128		invalid exit argumnet
128+X	Fatel error with linux signal
130		commnad terminated with Ctrl+C
255		exit status out of range


working with if-then statement

if command 
then
	commands
