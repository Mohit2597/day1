Review of Univariate Probability
	
		Probabality is a universally accepted tool for expressing degrees of confidence or doubt about some propositios in the presense of incomplete information or uncertainity. By convention, probabilities are calibrated on a scale of 0 to 1; assigning something a zero probabality amouts to expressing the belief that we consider it impossible, whereas assigning a probabality of 1 amounts to considering it a certainity. Most propositions fall somewhere in between. Probabality statements that we make can be base on our past experience, or on our personal judgements. Weather our probabaality statements are based on past experience or subjective personal judgements, they obey a common set of rules, which we can use to treat probabalities in a mathematical framework, and also for making decisions on predictions, for understanding complex systems, or as itellectual experiments and for entertainments. Probabality theory is one of the most applicable branches of mathematics. It is used as the primery tool for analyzing statistical methodologies; it is used routinely in nearly in every branch of science, such as biology, astronomy and physics, medicine, economics, chemistry, sociology, ecology, finance, and many others. A background in the theory, models and applications of probabality is almost a part of basic education. That is how important it is.
